    - The web application will be hosted on Linux servers and connecting to MySQL Database server.
 - Client Side:
    - An OS is capable of running a modern web browser which supports HTML

###	Tools and Technologies

#### Back-end:

 - JAVA
   - We are using Java because it’s is a highly portable language as it must be executed through a cross-platform compatible Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
	

 - MySQL
   - We are using MySQL because it’s a free, open-source database management system (DBMS for short). A DBMS is a system that manages databases and connects them to software. 
	


#### Front-end:

 - HTML5/CSS3
    - We are using HTML5 because it makes creating accessible sites easier for two main reasons: semantics and ARIA. ... ARIA is a W3C spec that is mainly used to assign specific “roles” to elements in an HTML document – essentially creating important landmarks on the page: header, footer, navigation or article, via role attributes.

 - JavaScript
   - We are using Javascript because its most commonly used as a client side scripting language. This means that JavaScript code is written into an HTML page. When a user requests an HTML page with JavaScript in it, the script is sent to the browser and it's up to the browser to do something with it.

 - Bootstrap
    - Bootstrap was also programmed to support both HTML5 and CSS3. Bootstrap is a free collection of tools for creating a websites and web applications. It contains HTML and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions.
